Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators (Done)
Assignment operators (Done)
Unary Operators
Bitwise operators
Logical operators
Relations Operators
Comparison operators
Ternary operators
Shift operators



Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	      Name	                Description	                                example
+	            Addition	            Adds together two values	                 x + y	
-	            Subtraction	            Subtracts one value from another	         x - y	
*	            Multiplication	        Multiplies two values	                     x * y	
/	            Division	            Divides one value by another	             x / y	
%	            Modulus	                Returns the division remainder	             x % y	
++	            Increment	            Increases the value of a variable by 1	     x++ | ++x
--	            Decrement	            Decreases the value of a variable by 1       x-- |	--x

Operator	     Example	       Same As	
=	              x = 5	            x = 5	
+=	              x += 3	        x = x + 3	
-=	              x -= 3	        x = x - 3	
*=	              x *= 3	        x = x * 3	
/=	              x /= 3	        x = x / 3	
%=	              x %= 3	        x = x % 3	

Bitwise
&=	              x &= 3	        x = x & 3
|=	              x |= 3	        x = x | 3	
^=	              x ^= 3	        x = x ^ 3	
>>=	              x >>= 3	        x = x >> 3	
<<=	              x <<= 3	        x = x << 3
